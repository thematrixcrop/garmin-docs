# Sensor Pairing

*Since API level 5.1.0*

If your device application or data field communicates wirelessly with a sensor or peripheral using ANT, ANT plus or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), then you will need to implement a pairing process. Connect IQ allows you to implement a [Sensor.SensorDelegate](/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/Sensor/SensorDelegate/) that allows you to have your device pair as part of the device’s sensor paring UI flow.

## Implementing a SensorDelegate

For the system to know that your device application or data field supports the native pairing flow, you will need your [AppBase.getSensorDelegate()](/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/Application/AppBase/#getSensorDelegate-instance_function) to return your implementation of your [Sensor.SensorDelegate](/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/Sensor/SensorDelegate/). In your delegate, your implementation of must return `true` to participate in a scan.

## Scanning for Your Device

When the user has the device scan for sensors, the system will start your app without a UI, request your sensor delegate and call your [SensorDelegate.onScan()](/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/Sensor/SensorDelegate/#onScan-instance_function). During this time, you can begin scanning for ANT or BLE devices.

If your scan reveals any devices, populate a Sensor.SensorInfo with the information and call Sensor.notifyNewSensor() for each device you detect. When your scan is complete, call to inform the system that you are done scanning. Since other apps also may need to scan for devices, use a realistic timeout, and notify quickly if no devices are detected.

## Pairing a Device

The user will be presented with a list of devices to choose from. If a device associated with your app is selected, your [Sensor.SensorDelegate](/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/Sensor/SensorDelegate/) will be re-instantiated, and the [SensorDelegate.onPair()](/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/Sensor/SensorDelegate/#onPair-instance_function) will be called with the [Sensor.SensorInfo](/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/Sensor/SensorInfo/) passed as a parameter. At this point, your app should do the necessary steps to pair the device. On ANT, this could be as simple as capturing the device id and persisting it, or with BLE it could involve persisting the ScanResult or establishing a bonded connection. Call [Sensor.notifyPairComplete()](/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/Sensor/#notifyPairComplete-instance_function) to complete the process.

## Unpairing a Device

Once your device is paired, it can be managed in the device Sensors list. The user can request that the system unpair from a device, as well. When requested, your [SensorDelegate.onUnpair()](/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/Sensor/SensorDelegate/#onUnpair-instance_function) will be invoked. Do the necessary cleanup and call [Sensor.notifyUnpairComplete()](/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/Sensor/#notifyUnpairComplete-instance_function) to complete the process.

## Pairing with Your Data Field or Application

If you add support for the native pairing flow, users will be prompted to pair with your sensor when the data field is installed. Applications typically want to pair devices as part of a setup flow. You can use `System.exitTo(new Intent("system://pairing", {}))` to exit the user to the native sensor scanning process.

## Testing in the Simulator

If you’d like to test your pairing code in the Connect IQ simulator, use the *Settings > Manage Sensors* option. Using the *Add* button will trigger your [Sensor.SensorDelegate](/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/Sensor/SensorDelegate/).

## Running app in sensor pairing mode from the Monkey C Extension

You can run and debug your pairing code in the Monkey C Extension by using the `Launch Native Pairing` command or run it with or without debugging via the `Run Native Pairing` launch configuration. For more information, see [Running App in Sensor Pairing Mode](/connect-iq/reference-guides/visual-studio-code-extension/#running-app-in-sensor-pairing-mode).

## Running app in sensor pairing from the Command Line

You can use the `monkeydo` script in your SDK's bin directory with the `/n` flag(`-n` on Mac) to run the app in sensor pairing mode:

```bash
> monkeydo path\to\projects\bin\MyApp.prg device_id /n
```
