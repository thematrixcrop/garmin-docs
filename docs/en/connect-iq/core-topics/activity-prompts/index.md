# Activity Prompts

*Since API 5.2.0*

The [Toybox.ActivityPrompts](/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/ActivityPrompts/) module allows for a data field to intercept and suppress the voice prompts of an activity. This can be used to integrate a device with its own text-to-speech (TTS) engine with the activity experience.

When installing an app that uses the [Toybox.ActivityPrompts](/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/ActivityPrompts/) API, the user will be presented with a confirmation asking if they agree to allow the app to control the voice prompts. The user can always select the app as the audio prompts handler either in the audio prompts menu or through device settings. Note that not all devices have an on-device audio prompts menu.

You can call [ActivityPrompts.registerActivityPromptsListener()](/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/ActivityPrompts/#registerActivityPromptsListener-instance_function) to register your app to handle activity prompts. This call will return true if the user has selected your app to handle activity prompts. If the user chooses to enable or disable your apps’ handling of activity prompts during the activity, your [ActivityPromptDelegate.onAudioOutputChange()](/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/ActivityPrompts/ActivityPromptDelegate/#onAudioOutputChange-instance_function) delegate function will be called with the status change.

When active, your [ActivityPromptDelegate.onPrompt()](/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/ActivityPrompts/ActivityPromptDelegate/#onPrompt-instance_function) will be passed an ActivityPrompt object when the user triggers lap, workout and other audio prompts. The [ActivityPrompt.text](/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/ActivityPrompts/ActivityPrompt/#text-var) will contain a TTS-friendly string in the current language. You can use to change the language of the text string. This will return `false` if the language is not supported. Calling does not change the system language.

If your external TTS engine is not available, calling [ActivityPrompts.unregisterActivityPromptsListener()](/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/ActivityPrompts/#unregisterActivityPromptsListener-instance_function) will disable the audio prompt handler. The device will fall back to the system audio prompt handler.
