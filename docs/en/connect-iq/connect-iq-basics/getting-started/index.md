2.  In the **Install the SDK Manager** section select *Accept & Download*

3.  Create a new folder in a convenient location

    1.  **Windows and Linux** - Copy the executable and support files to the new folder

    2.  **Mac** - Open the disk image and copy the SDK manager to the new folder

4.  Launch the SDK Manager. You should see the following:

#### The Monkey C Visual Studio Code Extension

The Monkey C extension adds support for using the Connect IQ SDK, including a syntax highlighting editor, build integration, and integrated debugger. The Monkey C extension requires [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview), version 11 or higher of the Oracle Java™ Runtime Environment, and Connect IQ SDK version 4.0.6 or higher.

##### Installing the Monkey C Extension

1.  In Visual Studio Code, go to the *View* > *Extension*

2.  In the Extensions Marketplace, search box type "Monkey C"

3.  Select the *Monkey C* extension from Garmin

4.  Use the *Install* button to install the extension in Visual Studio Code. This will require a restart of Visual Studio Code.

5.  After Visual Studio Code restarts, summon the command palette with *Ctrl + Shift + P* (*Command + Shift + P* on Mac)

6.  Type "Verify Installation" and select *Monkey C: Verify Installation*


#### Generating a Developer Key

The Connect IQ compiler requires a developer key to sign apps when they're compiled and packaged. The required key must be a RSA 4096 bit private key.

**Note:** It's important you keep track of the key you use to sign app packages. You will need to use the same key to sign updates to an existing app on the store. If you lose your original signing key you will not be able to update your app.

##### Generating a Key Using the Monkey C Extension

If you have a developer key, you can set the path to it by selecting *File > Preferences > Settings > Monkey C* and setting the *Monkey C: Developer Key Path* to your developer key. If you do not have a developer key, you can generate one using the following steps:

1.  Summon the command palette with *Ctrl + Shift + P* (*Command + Shift + P* on Mac)

2.  Type "Generate a developer key" and select *Monkey C: Generate a Developer Key*

3.  Select the directory in which to save your developer key


The developer key specified in the Connect IQ compiler preferences will automatically be passed to the compiler when a project is compiled.

Connect IQ only supports Ubuntu Linux distributions
