# Coding Conventions

Here are guidelines for Monkey C code:

## Naming

-   Modules and Classes are camel-cased with the first letter in upper case.

-   Functions are camel-cased with the first letter always being lower case.

-   Private class member variables are camel cased with the first character being an underscore (\_) and then the first letter lower case.

-   Public class member variables are camel cased with the first letter lower case.

-   Module variables should be camel cased with a lower cased first letter

-   Enums must have a common prefix, e.g. *COLOR\_RED*, *COLOR\_BLUE*.

-   In POMO (Plain Old Monkey C Objects) it is okay to have all public members.


## Source

-   Put one class per Monkey C source file.

-   Monkey C code should use spaces aligned four spaces per indent level. The Monkey C editor will automatically convert spaces to tabs and remove trailing white space.

-   When defining modules, classes, functions, and enums, put the opening brace on the same line as the definition and the closing brace aligned with the first character as the definition.


## Definitions

-   Avoid pure global variables when possible.

-   Because modules are not purely lexical and have runtime memory cost, putting class definitions into the global module is acceptable.

-   Avoid having public static members in class definitions; instead move those definitions into the parent module.

-   In the first line of your class initialize function, always call the superclass initialize.


## Sample

Here is a sample:

```cpp
class SampleName extends Toybox.Application.AppBase
{
    public var publicVar;
    private var _privateVar;

    function initialize() {
        AppBase.initialize();
    }
    // onStart() is called on application start up
    function onStart(state) {
    }

    // onStop() is called when your application is exiting
    function onStop(state) {
    }

    // Return the initial view of your application here
    function getInitialView(){
        return [new SampleNameView(), new SampleNameDelegate()];
    }
 }
```
