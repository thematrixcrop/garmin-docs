# Jungle Reference Guide

Welcome to Jungles, the build language for Connect IQ apps. This guide will cover the following topics:

-   The [syntax](/connect-iq/reference-guides/jungle-reference/#jungle-syntax) of the jungle build language

-   Using [build exclusions](/connect-iq/reference-guides/jungle-reference/#excluded-annotations) to tailor your apps at build time

-   Managing [monkey barrels](/connect-iq/reference-guides/jungle-reference/#monkey-barrel-management)

-   Using Jungles [with Visual Studio Code](/connect-iq/reference-guides/jungle-reference/#using-jungles-with-visual-studio-code) or from the [command line](/connect-iq/reference-guides/jungle-reference/#using-jungles-from-the-command-line)


## Jungle Syntax

Jungle files contain *build instructions* that are made up of *qualifiers*, *local variables*, and *values*. Jungle files may also contain *comments*. Each build instruction is made up of qualifier-value or variable-value pairs separated by an equal sign (`=`), and terminate with a new line character.

Qualifiers are analogous to the [device and family qualifiers](/connect-iq/core-topics/build-configuration/#device-family-and-localization-qualifiers) described in the previous section. They are treated as reserved words, can only be set equal to other qualifiers, and are globally scoped. Qualifiers and their properties can be used with the dereference operator `$(VAR)` and are evaluated after all Jungle files for a project have been processed.

### Project Qualifiers

Project qualifiers specify global information that applies across the project. Project qualifiers have x properties that can be referenced by following `project` with a dot (`.`) and a property name:

| Qualifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `manifest` | Path to the manifest file for the project |
| `optimization` | Specifies the optimization level for the project. See the [`--optimization` compiler option](/connect-iq/monkey-c/compiler-options/#compiler-options) for details |
| `typecheck` | Specifies the type check level. See the [`--typecheck` compiler option](/connect-iq/monkey-c/compiler-options/#compiler-options) for details |

### Device Qualifiers

Device qualifiers have six properties that can be referenced by following a qualifier with a dot (`.`) and a property name:

| Qualifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `annotations` | Monkey Barrel annotations applicable to this qualifier |
| `barrelPath` | Monkey Barrel file (`.barrel`) paths applicable to this qualifier |
| `excludeAnnotations` | Annotations to exclude when building for this qualifier |
| `lang` | The language(s) supported by this qualifier |
| `personality` | Monkey style file (`.mss`) paths applicable to this qualifier |
| `resourcePath` | Resource file (`.xml`) paths applicable to this qualifier |
| `sourcePath` | Source file (`.mc`) paths applicable to this qualifier |

### Local Variables

Variables are a convenient way of re-using values, such as long path strings. Unlike qualifiers, local variables have no properties, cannot be set equal to a qualifier, and are locally scoped. Variables can be used with the dereference operator `$(VAR)` and are evaluated after the Jungle file in which they are defined has been processed.

### Values

Values are a list of one or more string values that represent the value of a particular qualifier, qualifier property, or local variable. Multiple list items are separated by semicolons (`;`).

Spaces in string values must be contained within quotes. For example, a source or resource path that contains a space should be defined in the following way:

```
fenix5.sourcePath = "my projects/my source/file.mc";"my fenix5 source"
```

### Comments

Lines preceded with a hash mark (`#`) are treated as comments and are ignored by the compiler.

A basic Jungle file build instruction will use this pattern (comments are optional):

```
# This is a comment
qualifier[.property] = value
```

Jungle files must be named with a `.jungle` extension, and are kept in the root of the Connect IQ project.

**Note:** Dereferenced qualifiers are evaluated "lazily", which means that when building for a specific device, all qualifiers and properties are resolved for that device after all Jungle files are processed, while local variables will be resolved after processing the Jungle files in which they are defined. The exception to lazy evaluation is when a qualifier or local variable is dereferenced when *setting* that qualifier or variable, in which case the qualifier or variable is evaluated during Jungle file processing.

## Sources and Resources

Setting source and resource paths are a common use for Jungles. In addition to tailoring source code and resources to particular devices to improve user experience, it can also help with memory management since only the sources defined in the Jungle file are compiled into the executable.

As a practical example, assume an application will use a shared set of resources for fēnix devices contained in a `fenix-resources` directory at the root of the project. Since these products are not all in the same [families](/connect-iq/core-topics/build-configuration/#family-qualifiers), a custom Jungle file must be written to tell the compiler these devices should use this shared resources folder. We can start by setting the resource path for fēnix 5:

```
# Set the fenix 5 resource directory
fenix5.resourcePath = $(fenix5.resourcePath);fenix-resources
```

Let's break this down a little:

fenix5.resourcePath

The device qualifier for the fēnix 5 defined in the default Jungle file followed by the resourcePath property

$(fenix5.resourcePath);

The original value of the fenix5.resourcePath property, accessed with the dereference operator `$(VAR)`.

The default Jungle file defines the base resource path as the `resource` directory in the root of the project, and all devices inherit this. It also defines device-specific and family-specific resource directories that can be used implicitly in any project. Including this in the resource path ensures that the device can still look in these directories for resources if required resources aren't found in more device-specific locations. If this is omitted, it would tell the compiler to only look for fenix 5 resources in the `fenix-resources` directory.

fenix-resources

The shared directory we want to add as a resource location for the device.

If this looks familiar, it's because it's pretty similar in concept to setting [PATH environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)). Path precedence goes from left to right in Jungle files, so the compiler will process inherited resources first before processing resources found within 'fenix-resources', which can potentially override resources already defined. Adding the `fenix-resources` directory to other fēnix devices just requires similar instructions for each additional device:

```
# Set the fenix 5 resource locations
fenix5.resourcePath = $(fenix5.resourcePath);fenix-resources

# Set the fenix 3 resource locations
fenix3.resourcePath = $(fenix3.resourcePath);fenix-resources
...
```

Setting source paths works in essentially the same way, allowing apps to selectively include specific source code on a per-device or per-device family basis. As an example, consider an app that has common code shared by all products in the `source` folder and product-line specific source code in other folders: `wearable-source` for wearable devices, `edge-source` for bike computers, and `handheld-source` for handheld mapping units. The following demonstrates how to use a jungle to configure this project:

```
# Reset the base source path to include only source files in the source folder. The
# default source path includes source files in the project folder and all subfolders.
base.sourcePath = source

# Set the source path for wearable devices by device family
round.sourcePath = $(round.sourcePath);wearable-source
semiround.sourcePath = $(semiround.sourcePath);wearable-source

# Set the source path for edge devices by device
edge530.sourcePath = $(edge530.sourcePath);edge-source
edge830.sourcePath = $(edge830.sourcePath);edge-source
edge1030.sourcePath = $(edge1030.sourcePath);edge-source

# Set source path for handheld devices by device
gpsmap66.sourcePath = $(gpsmap66.sourcePath);handheld-source
oregon7xx.sourcePath = $(oregon7xx.sourcePath);handheld-source
rino7xx.sourcePath = $(rino7xx.sourcePath);handheld-source
```

### Localization Resources

Localization strings are a kind of resource in Connect IQ, but have a slightly different syntax since multiple languages may be supported by a single device or device family. Suppose an application supports both English and Spanish, and all of the fēnix English localization resources are stored in a `fenix-resources-eng` directory, while the Spanish localization resources are kept in a `fenix-resources-spa` directory.

```
# Set the fenix 5 English language resource location
fenix5.lang.eng = $(fenix5.lang.eng);fenix-resources-eng

# Set the fenix 5 Spanish language resource location
fenix5.lang.spa = $(fenix5.lang.spa);fenix-resources-spa

# Set the fenix 3 English language resource location
fenix3.lang.eng = $(fenix3.lang.eng);fenix-resources-eng

# Set the fenix 3 Spanish language resource location
fenix3.lang.spa = $(fenix3.lang.spa);fenix-resources-spa
...
```

The `lang` qualifier property is used in this build instruction to specify that a localization resource is being set, and is followed by an additional [ISO 639–2 language code](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) localization qualifier to indicate for which language the supplied resource locations are intended. A list of supported localization qualifiers can be found in the [Strings](/connect-iq/core-topics/resources/#strings) section. Specifying an unsupported localization qualifier will result in an error at compile time.

When specifying localization resources within Jungle files, the supported languages must also be set in a project's manifest, otherwise the associated localization overrides will be ignored.

## Excluded Annotations

In some cases, there are specific modules, classes, methods, or variables that should only be used by a subset of devices, but excluding an entire source file is excessive. The `excludeAnnotations` qualifier property allows build instructions to specify specific [annotations](/connect-iq/monkey-c/annotations/#annotations) that will be excluded when an application is built. This may help save memory during app execution on a device.

A common reason for excluding source is when an application uses one algorithm that takes advantage of the latest APIs on newer devices, but must use a simpler algorithm on older devices that don't have the latest APIs available. For example, the following example shows an app that has two methods—one that uses the newer [Sensor.AccelerometerData](/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/Sensor/AccelerometerData/), and one that relies on [Info.accel](/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/Sensor/Info/#accel-var) data:

```cpp
import Toybox.WatchUi;

const experimental = Toybox.Sensor has :AccelerometerData;

class MyAmazingAppView extends WatchUi.View {

    function onUpdate(dc) {

        sharedLogic();

        if (experimental) {
            // If a newer device, call the new logic
            newHotnessLogic();
        } else {
            // If an older device, call the old logic
            oldAndBoringLogic();
        }
    }

    function newHotnessLogic() {
        // Advanced functionality using Sensor.AccelerometerData
    }

    function oldAndBoringLogic() {
        // Basic functionality using Sensor.Info.accel data
    }

    function sharedLogic() {
        // Shared logic
    }
}
```

This will function properly as-is, but all of the code is included regardless of the build target. If the app is approaching memory limits, it may be useful to exclude the unused method, especially if the method is sufficiently large and impacts available memory. To do this, set the `excludeAnnotations` qualifier property in the Jungle file to the appropriate annotation value:

```
# By default, exclude the new, experimental logic
base.excludeAnnotations = experimental
# Exclude the old, boring logic from fenix 5
fenix5.excludeAnnotations = boring
```

Then, update the application to use annotations:

```cpp
import Toybox.WatchUi;

(:boring) const experimental = false;
(:experimental) const experimental = Toybox.Sensor has :AccelerometerData;

class MyAmazingAppView extends WatchUi.View {

    function onUpdate(dc) {
        // If a newer device, call the new logic
        // otherwise, call the old logic
        myAlgorithm();
    }

    (:experimental)
    function myAlgorithm() {
        sharedLogic();
        if (experimental) {
            newHotnessLogic();
        } else {
            throw new MyException("Toybox.Sensor.AccelerometerData not supported!");
        }
    }

    (:boring)
    function myAlgorithm() {
        sharedLogic();
        oldAndBoringLogic();
    }

    (:experimental)
    function newHotnessLogic() {
        // Advanced functionality using Sensor.AccelerometerData
    }

    (:boring)
    function oldAndBoringLogic() {
        // Basic functionality using Sensor.Info.accel data
    }

    function sharedLogic() {
        // Shared logic
    }
}
```

## Monkey Barrel Management

Barrels can also be added manually to the project's main Jungle file using the `barrelPath` qualifier property:

```
# Include all the Barrels from the 'barrels' directory at the root of the project
base.barrelPath = barrels

# Include a specific Barrel from the 'barrels' directory
base.barrelPath = barrels/IconLibrary.barrel

# Include multiple, specific Barrels from the 'barrels' directory
base.barrelPath = barrels/IconLibrary.barrel;barrels/GraphLibrary.barrel
```

It's also possible to use the `annotations` qualifier property to import select, annotated portions of a barrel. This is useful when a Barrel contains a library of classes and methods, but an application only needs to use a fragment of the library. For example, assume the GraphLibrary barrel imported above contains several different graphing methods, but an application only needs to use a bar graph. The Barrel author was kind enough to annotate each method, so rather than using the entire Barrel, we can limit imported code to only those methods that are needed:

```
# Import the 'bar' annotated method from the GraphLibrary Barrel
base.GraphLibrary.annotations = bar
```

In order for the compiler to correctly resolve Monkey Barrels, Barrel dependencies must also be added to the project's manifest file:

```cpp
<iq:barrels>
    <iq:depends name="IconLibrary" version="0.0.0"/>
</iq:barrels>
```

Once completed, the specified Barrels will be available for use in a project.

## Defining Project Dependencies

What if a quick change is made to a developer's barrel code in the development process of a dependant application? It would be cumbersome to [export a barrel](/connect-iq/core-topics/shareable-libraries/#exporting-a-monkey-barrel) and update the dependencies in the manifest.xml every time the code is changed in the Barrel project. Connect IQ application projects can have direct Monkey Barrel project dependencies removing the need for these steps.

Adding a Barrel project dependency is done by specifying the Jungle file or files of the project or projects depended upon within the `barrelPath`. Jungle files can be specified individually or grouped in the `barrelPath`.

For example, a developer is creating an application, but she wants to include a standard set of icons that define her brand. She realizes in development that she needs to add a few more icons and decides to finally create that super specialized function that she is always needing. She can work dynamically on both projects and link her application project to her Barrel code by adding the Barrel project's Jungle file to the `barrePath` like this:

```
# Include a specific Barrel project
base.barrelPath = MyIconBarrel/MyIconBarrel.jungle
```

Another developer is working on a math intensive application. Thankfully, someone has created an extensive MathLibrary Barrel that he has pulled in. He also has a local MyIconLibrary Barrel project with some standard icons. He has a set of icons for round devices defined in a `roundIcons.jungle` file that he wants to use in his application. He includes both the packaged MathLibrary.barrel and his own roundIcons defined in his local barrel project like this:

```
# Include a specific Barrel from the 'barrels' directory and a Jungle from a Barrel project
base.barrelPath = barrels/MathLibrary.barrel;MyIconBarrel/roundIcons.jungle
```

Our second developer realizes that he wants to support rectangle devices as well. These have been defined in a `rectangleIcons.jungle`. He includes multiple build instructions from MyIconBarrel by grouping the Jungle files in square brackets `[]` like this:

```
# Include a specific Barrel from the 'barrels' directory and multiple Jungles from a Barrel project
base.barrelPath = barrels/MathLibrary.barrel;[MyIconBarrel/roundIcons.jungle;MyIconBarrel/rectangleIcons.jungle]
```

Take a look at the (../Core\_Topics/Shareable.md Libraries#shareablelibraries) chapter to learn more about Monkey Barrels and how they can be used.

## The Default Jungle File

The Connect IQ SDK includes a default Jungle file, which is always applied to projects even if no custom Jungle files are present. It defines a `base` qualifier, which represents all source files (`.mc`) contained in the project, and all resource files found in the `resources` at the root of a Connect IQ project. It also defines default device, family, and language qualifiers that are the basis for the qualifier scheme described in the previous section.

When a project is built, the instructions from the default Jungle file are applied first, then any instructions from custom Jungle files are applied. This makes it possible for customizations to override the default build instructions.

## Using Jungles with Visual Studio Code

By default, each project is configured to look for a `monkey.jungle` file in the root of the project and will use it if it exists. However, if a project is organized differently or a different Jungle file name is preferred, the Jungle file location can be set easily by going to *File > Preferences > Settings* and editing the *Monkey C* settings:


![Jungle file specification in Visual Studio Code](/connect-iq/resources/programmers-guide/vscode-jungles.png)

## Using Jungles from the Command Line

For those who prefer to use the `monkeyc` [shell command](/connect-iq/reference-guides/monkey-c-command-line-setup/#basic-commands) to build projects rather than Visual Studio Code, the `-f` option is required and accepts a list of Jungle files, separated by semicolons (`;`) or colons (`:`):

```
monkeyc -o myApp.prg myApp.mc -d fenix5 -f monkey.jungle;monkey2.jungle
```

In lieu of this new option, the `-z` option to specify resource paths, the `-x` option to specify build exclusions, the `-m` option to specify the manifest file, and the ability to specify source paths have been deprecated and will be removed in a future SDK release. Here is a general description of how this will work:

-   When specifying a Jungle file with the `-f` option, the [default Jungle file](/connect-iq/reference-guides/jungle-reference/#the-default-jungle-file) will first be applied to the project before the specified Jungle file is applied

-   If more than one Jungle file is provided after the `-f` option, precedence will be given to the build instructions in the last Jungle file in the list

-   If no resource or source options are specified, either as a Jungle file the compiler will attempt to apply the [default Jungle file](/connect-iq/reference-guides/jungle-reference/#the-default-jungle-file) to the project

-   Use of both the `-f` option and any deprecated options in combination is not allowed and will cause a compiler error


The manifest file of the project must be specified within a Jungle file passed at the command line and any Jungle can contain this specification. Here is what it looks like:

```
project.manifest = manifest.xml
```

There can be only one manifest file defined within the set of jungle files provided. When relative paths are used within a jungle file the path will be resolved against the Jungle file's parent directory. Relative paths within the `default.jungle` are resolved against the parent directory of the manifest file that is found.

**Note:** Legacy projects using `-m`, `-x`, `-z`, and/or supplying source files at the command line will result in a compiler warning.

Resist urge... to make... reference...

When multiple manifests are found, one must destroy the other and absorb its power to become the strongest manifest.
