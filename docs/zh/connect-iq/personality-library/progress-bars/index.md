# Progress Indicators

At points where your app needs to perform an asynchronous operation, such as loading an update or a new view, you should indicate to the user that they need to wait. Progress indicators provide a full-page experience informing the user the process is ongoing while they wait.

## Percent Progress Indicator

If you quantify the percentage or time 您需要 complete a process, you can use a percent progress indicator to present that progress to the user.

### Example

WatchUI.ProgressBar shows a progress percentage if you initialize it with a value between 0 to 100. Call [ProgressBar.setProgress()](/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/WatchUi/ProgressBar/#setProgress-instance_function) to update the progress displayed.

```typescript
// InputDelegate.mc

    progressBar = new WatchUi.ProgressBar(
        "Processing...",
        0
    );
    WatchUi.pushView(
        progressBar,
        new MyProgressDelegate(),
        Ui.SLIDE_DOWN
    );
```

## Infinite Progress Indicator

If you do not have a known progress end point, you can use an infinite progress mode. This displays a spinning indicator to show that a task is ongoing.

### Example

[WatchUi.ProgressBar](/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/WatchUi/ProgressBar/) shows a busy progress if you initialize it with a `null` value.

```typescript
// InputDelegate.mc

    progressBar = new WatchUi.ProgressBar(
        "Processing...",
        null
    );
    WatchUi.pushView(
        progressBar,
        new MyProgressDelegate(),
        Ui.SLIDE_DOWN
    );
```
